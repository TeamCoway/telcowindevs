### Steps to create Web-to-Lead

1. Select `Setup > Feature Settings > Marketing > Web-to-Lead` and click `Create Web-to-Lead Form`.
2. Add fields to capture, insert the return URL, and click `Generate`.
3. Copy the generated HTML form and paste it on the 3rd party website.

Take note of these 3 lines:

```html
<form action="https://webto.salesforce.com/servlet/servlet.WebToLead?encoding=UTF-8" method="POST" />
<input type="hidden" name="oid" value="<OID-VALUE>" />
<input type="hidden" name="retURL" value="<RETURN-URL-VALUE>" />
```

- Line 1: The data will be sent to the URL when the form is submitted   
- Line 2: The `<OID-VALUE>` is the Organization ID or org id. You can get the Organization ID in `Setup > Company Settings > Company Information`.   
- Line 3: The `<RETURN-URL-VALUE>` is where the user will be redirected after they submit the form.   


> Note: You can modify the form styling as you need. Just make sure the `name` attribute for all fields is the same as in the Lead object.
